The main file for this code is SARSA.m, which is where all the learning is performed, right now it outputs the control results for a disturbed set of initial states. The .mat files contain knowledge obtained during training so that SARSA.m can be tested with a low run time (the function "par" in line 138 can be used to modify the SARSA parameters). Also, environment. contains the state-space model of the pitch dynamics of the plane, and Q_function_approximator.m is used to visualize the Q-table as well as the policy. Finally, verification_tests.m is used for verifying certain parts of the call (as it is know, there are two tests that can be modified in line 7, the open-loop response of the environment, and the testing of the discretization functions).
